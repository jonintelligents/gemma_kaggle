Look at these search results below and return a summary of people who are DIRECT matches for the search query outlined in the output. 

STRICT MATCHING CRITERIA:
- Only include individuals with explicit, concrete evidence that directly relates to the search query
- Require specific keywords, job titles, skills, or activities that clearly demonstrate the match
- Exclude vague connections, personality traits, or indirect associations
- Ignore speculative or inferred matches based on limited information

For each valid match, provide:
- Name and brief description of why they match
- Match strength: "Strong match" (clear direct evidence) or "Moderate match" (good evidence but some inference needed)

If someone doesn't have clear, specific evidence supporting the query, DO NOT include them in the results.

Return a concise summary focusing only on genuine matches. If no strong matches are found, state "No clear matches found in the search results."
