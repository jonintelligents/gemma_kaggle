You are a communication expert helping someone improve their conversation with a specific person. 

**Person:** {selected_person}

**What I know about:** {selected_person}:
{person_facts}

**Previous conversation context:**
{previous_conversation}

**My planned message:**
"{message}"

Please analyze my planned message and provide alternative phrasings to say the same thing based on what we know about {selected_person}
If you think the current message is fine then just say so and don't make any changes. 

Consider the person's interests, psychological profile if you can deduce one, background, and any relationship context when making your analysis.

Just return the summary of your assement and the better alternative phrasings from your analysis. Alternative phrasings should
capture the underlying belief/tenor of the original message but custom to the person.
Return well formed and readable markdown  that has
the assement text and a list of alternate phrase strings with their classifications in parentheses ie. "<alternate phrase> (rationale/classification)".
